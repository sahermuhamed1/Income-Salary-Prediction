## Income Salary Prediction Data Science ProjectðŸª™

*Special Thanks to Ziad Mostafa for their significant contributions to this project.*

### This project aims to predict if the income salary for anyone is more than 50.000$ per year or not!

The project involves predicting salary categories based on various features using a pre-trained machine learning model. The following files are included:

- *Features.csv:* Dataset containing unique values for different features.
- *README.md:* This file with project documentation.
- *adult-income-pred.ipynb:* Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model selection.
- *adult.csv:* The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- *model.pkl:* Pre-trained machine learning model stored as a pickle file.
- *py.py:* Python script using Streamlit to create a web app for deploying the model.
- *requirements.txt:* File specifying the project dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. *Clone the Repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahermuhamed1/Income-Salary-Prediction/edit/main/README.md
   cd Income-Salary-Prediction
   

2. *Install Dependencies:*
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. *Run the Web App:*
   bash
   streamlit run py.py
   

   Visit the displayed URL in your web browser to interact with the salary prediction web app.

## Usage

1. The Jupyter Notebook (adult-income-pred.ipynb) provides insights into data analysis, preprocessing, and model selection.

2. The Python script (py.py) uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly web app for predicting salary categories based on user input.

3. The pre-trained model (model.pkl) is used for making predictions in the web app.

4. Explore the dataset (adult.csv) for a better understanding of the data.

## Web App Usage

1. After running the web app, adjust sliders and dropdowns to input user-specific features.
2. Observe the predicted income category based on the selected features.
